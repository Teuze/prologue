# Generic packer templates

I know this already exists on GitHub but I wanted something simple,
and making this allowed me to understand Packer a little bit more.

## Requirements

You need VirtualBox and a (decent) Internet connection.

## Usage

```
packer build --force {debian*,ubuntu*}.json
```
